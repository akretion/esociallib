Introduction
==============

esociallib helps to process XML instance documents that obey the
esocial XML schema.

With esociallib (esociallib.py) you can write
Python code to:

- Parse an XML document that obeys the esocial XML schema,
  creating instances of the Python classes that represent the types
  defined in the esocial schema.  These Python classes are
  defined in esociallib.py.

- Create instances of classes that represent the types described in
  the esocial XML schema.

- Write Python application code that uses the classes that
  represent esocial types.

- Export the objects to an XML document.


Schemas
---------

The esociallib.py module in this package was generated from the
XML schemas in ./schemas.


generateDS.py
---------------

The esociallib.py module in this package was generated by
generateDS.py.  You can learn about generateDS.py here:
